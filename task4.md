# task 4

The first script runs a series of questions that prompt the user for a response. 
It in turn records the responses from the user in a file. 
It adds the data as a timestamp and saves the information to a CSV file

The second script imports the CSV file into a database and creates a table with information from the CSV file. 
It then puts the information in a .sql file inside my repository
