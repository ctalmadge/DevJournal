# 1st post

I have learned how helpful writing in markdown is through the creation of a website. 
HTML is not only somewhat unapproachable, but it is fary too easy to make mistakes. 
Beginning by writing the bulk in markdown not only streamlines the process but helps to save for errors. 

I especially appreciated this part during the creation of the final presentation. 
Although I learned how to manipulate the HTML in the slides, it was far too easy to make a simple mistake and break the slide.
By being able to convert between markdown and HTML I feel confident on a beginner's grasp.By
